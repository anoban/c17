// How do Windows user space applications communicate with the OS kernel?

// Windows has two modes
// 1) User mode
// 2) Kernel mode

// User mode applications are subject to certain restrictions - cannot access hardware directly, can only access memory it owns!
// this includes prohibition from using specialized CPU instructions, if a user space application tries to use them, a hardware exeption will be raised!
// Kernel mode applications, on the contrary, have direct access to hardware and can access the whole of the physical memory

// Intel CPUs have 4 priority levels :: 0, 1, 2 and 3
// User space applications request services from the OS kernel using system calls
// these system calls use special assembly instructions like syscall, sysenter or int (stands for interrupt)
// immediately after a system call invocation, the execution mode gets escalated to kernel mode
// the syscall request and its arguments are validated
// the kernel prepares and provides the requested service and returns a status code
// indicative of the status of the requested service provision

// all the Windows native API routines have a name prefixed with "Nt"
// Microsoft openly discourages programmers from using the native API directly, as it's subject to frequent undocumented changes
// and encourages to use the Win32 API, that's guranteed to remain stable! All the refactorings, bug fixes, and what not happens in the native API
// and MS exposes a safe and stable encapsulation layer for programmers, the Win32 API

// most function calls a user space programme makes can travel down to various depths
// call to a user defined routine will contain the execution control within the programme itself.

// if it makes a call to a function from the language runtime, e.g. msvcrt.dll or ucrt.dll
// the execution control will temporarily move to the library code and return back.

// if it calls a function (be it user defined or from language runtime) that needs system services
// the call needs to travel into the kernel space to collect the required service
// if so happens, the function will likely call a Win32 routine
// which will load kernel32.dll to broker the request to the kernel space
// the called routine in the kernel32.dll will then call the corresponding native api, using a call to ntdll.dll
// the chosen routine in the ntdll will finally make the syscall!
// and the control will be returned back to the user space application, through all the layers involved in making the syscall
// in the reverse order

// however, there are ways to sidestep these cascades of control change
// a user space application can directly call the necessary native APIs, overstepping the modiation by the language runtime and Win32 API

// most native API routines have APIs in the Win32 subsystem with names removed of the Nt prefix
// C language runtime does a lot of work before calling an application's main() or wmain() function
// with C++, invoking exit or abort or ExitProcess or NtTerminateProcess may prevent proper cleanup expected of destructors

// Windows supports three CPU instructions to escalate privelege level to Ring 0
// syscall, sysenter and int 2E
// int 2E - system interrupt (has some overhead)
// sysenter is introduced later as a faster alternative
// syscall is the new improved alternative on Intel & AMD CPUs.

// over the time, many native API functions has been removed and newly introduced or modified by Microsoft
// Microsoft documents some of the native APIs, soley for the use in kernel drivers
// Inside the windows kernel, the name of the routine invoked by the native API has the same name
// i.e NtTerminateProcess from NT API uses a syscall instruction to call a routine named NtTerminateProcess inside the kernel space

// however, the function in the kernel space has ring 0 priveleges (runs in trusted mode)
// it doesn't do any argument validation, because by design the vetting part is delegated to the routines in Win32 and NT runtimes
// the kernel takes the arguments it receives for granted!

// some cognate kernel functions have a Zw prefix replacing the Nt prefix of their NT API counterparts.
// e.g NtTerminateProcess in NT API may have a ZwTerminateProcess or NtTerminateProcess in the kernel space
// calling an NT API function with a Nt prefix may lead to a routine prefixed with Zw or Nt being dispatched in kernel space
// e.g NtDoSomething -> NtDoSomething or ZwDoSomething in kernel space
